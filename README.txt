This is a program developed for the OS class at PUC-Rio.

Developer: Gabriel Lima
Professor: Alexandre Meslin

Date: 04/06/2012

To run the program you need:
1) Install python 2.7.x installed. (pref. 2.7.3)
2) cd into the directory with the extracted files (make sure the directory is visible to the PYTHONPATH enviroment variable)
3) type "python proc_shed_simulator.py <inputfilename>", there's an example "proc.txt" inputfile binded into the .zip
3) voi la!

Observation: This is the first program I ever programmed using the Pyhton programming language. Sorry for any bad practices.
